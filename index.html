                Clickspeed doesn't make a difference unless you're actually going to become a pro

                W-tapping, the key to combos. So you may see a lot of montages where people are knocked into the air and
                kept
                there for about 5-6 hits, and they don't manage to get a single hit on the attacker. How? W-tapping.
                Basically,
                if you hit someone while sprinting, they take increased knockback (kb). But, there is a setting where if
                you
                hold down ctrl (I happen to use shift) and w, you'll maintain the sprint even after you hit someone.
                While it
                does maintain the sprint, your next hits after the first will no longer cause the target to take
                increased kb.
                As you continue to hit the guy, you'll find that you often run through him, or shorten the distance
                between you
                two to where he can actually hit you. Now, the solution is to w-tap. Basically, when you get the first
                hit on a
                dude, they take increased kb. Chances are though, they are still sprinting towards you trying to get a
                hit. Now,
                you quickly release and repress the w key. What this does is reset your sprint, and allows your next hit
                to deal
                the increased kb. Keep repeating. What really happens is this: you get the first hit, the enemy is
                knocked
                backwards. As I'll explain in my next point, getting knocked back actually decreases your reach. Thus,
                at this
                point in time, as he gets knocked back, he is losing reach. At the same time, you w-tap, and are
                sprinting so
                you can still hit him. He almost gets in range of you, but you have more reach due to him being knocked
                back.
                You hit him again. He is an idiot an attempts to keep his sprint. You w-tap. You get more reach. You hit
                him
                first again. Versus, if you weren't w-tapping, he wouldn't take a lot of kb, you'd get too close to him
                as you
                are sprinting, and he hits you and you have no control. Ladies and gentlemen, that is w-tapping.

                Why do people actually use a fishing rod? Let me explain. Because of ping and network latency being
                imperfect,
                you actually gain more reach while sprinting forward. Why? Because (I think) minecraft works in "ticks,"
                where
                the system updates itself. Think of it like a second hand on a clock. Every "tick," each object updates
                its
                position. Let's just say that having a delay on that "tick" forces the system to compensate, essentially
                putting
                you into the future where you are slightly ahead of your current position, giving you more reach. It's a
                bit
                technical, but all you need to know is that sprinting = more reach, getting kbed= less reach. Now,
                fishing rods
                do no damage to players, but will knock them back. You see where this is going? If I have two players
                running at
                each other in a straight, narrow corridor, one person throws the rod, knocking the other back. Person
                who gets
                knocked back gets less reach, person who knocked the guy gets more reach since he is still sprinting.
                Thus, he
                gets the first hit. And then the w-tapping combos commence. Now, you normally want to throw the rod 5-7
                blocks
                away from your opponent. Quickly hotkey to your sword once it lands, w-tap, and you should get a combo.
                You
                should practice though to see where your rod "sweet spot" is. All depends on ping. Of course, you have
                to
                predict their movement if they are strafing you and aim the rod ahead of where they will be, so it gets
                much
                harder. I'm not even going to talk about rod v rod pvp because thats honestly just dumb. If you ever get
                into
                one of those scenarios, either pray they suck or run away as fast as you can and bow spam.

                Rod tricking. You normally only want to use this when sneaking up on someone, because it requires you to
                jump.
                And let me say this one thing. NEVER, EVER, IN YOUR LIFE, EVER, JUMP IN FLATGROUND MINECRAFT PVP!!
                Basically,
                lowground gives you more reach, so jumping, aka highground, lowers your reach. It's weird. Basically, to
                rod
                trick, wait till you are close to them, rod them, jump, and do a critical hit. Your rod and critical hit
                should
                land at roughly the same time. It will actually do double damage. It's weird I know. I can explain why,
                but it's
                technical and you don't care. Just know it's a thing, but you normally won't be doing it. Practice on
                zombies
                just in case.

                Bow tricks are almost the same thing as a rod. Just bow them, knock them back, and go in for first hit.
                Same
                idea. You can do it with snowballs and eggs as well.

                Lavabucket/cobwebs. You need to be really fast with hotkeys and have good control over your mouse. As
                two
                players run at each other, or as someone runs at you, have sword in hand. Quickly hotkey to
                lavabucket/cobweb
                and place it one or two blocks in front of where they will be so they cant react. They will get trapped
                in it,
                and free hits. Keep in mind that descending down cobwebs give them critical hits, so always strafe
                around them
                HARD as they are in lava/cobwebs so you can hit them but they cant hit you. If you just stand in one
                place and
                hit them, they will beat you since they get crits every hit.

                MLG Waterbucket. I'm sure you've seen it. If you're falling down a cliff or something, hotkey to water
                bucket
                and aim for the block you will land on. Spam right click right before you hit the ground and you will
                place the
                water. You'll land in it and not take fall damage. If you want to be cool, place it and instantly pick
                it up
                again.
